## Domain Modeling
<br>

### Game:
- Properties: None

<br>

#### In this simplified model, the focus is solely on the concept of the game itself without any persistence or tracking of game instances, rounds, or outcomes.
<br>

#### Each time the game is played, it would be a standalone session without any connections or dependencies to previous games. 

#### The game state would be managed within the runtime of the game and wouldn't be saved or persisted.
