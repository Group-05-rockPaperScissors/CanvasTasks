### Rock-Paper-Scissors
<br>

####  Rock-Paper-Scissors is a classic hand game played between two individuals. The game revolves around three gestures: rock, paper, and scissors, each representing a different object or action.

####  Rock is represented by a clenched fist, paper by an open hand, and scissors by extending the index and middle fingers in a V-shape.

#### The objective of the game is to outwit your opponent by selecting a gesture that defeats theirs. Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.

#### The game is often played in a best-of-three format, where the first player to win two rounds is declared the winner.

#### Rock-Paper-Scissors is popular for its simplicity, quick gameplay, and the element of chance involved, making it a widely enjoyed pastime around the world.
